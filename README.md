# Project-3_AirQuality

This project is about exploring air quality data in the world. We will use the [Air Quality Index (AQI)] to measure air quality. The AQI is a measure of how polluted the air is, and it is based on several pollutants, including particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide.

## Data

The data for this project is from https://open-meteo.com/ 
It includes the AQI and other pollutants, such as PM2.5, ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We will start by exploring the data to get a better understanding of air quality in the world. We will look at the distribution of the AQI, as well as the levels of different pollutants. We will also examine how air quality varies over time and location.

## Visualization

We will visualize the data to make it easier to understand. We will create maps of air quality in the world, and we will also create graphs of the AQI over time.

The application is divided into three files:

1. Weather App/script.js: This file contains the code for the weather app. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on the screen.

2. Map/script.js: This file contains the code for the map visualization. It creates a map of the world and adds layers for air quality data and AQI stations.

3. Plots/plot.js: This file contains the code for the plot visualization. It creates a plot of air quality data for a given location.

To run the application, you will need to install the following dependencies:

* d3: A JavaScript library for data visualization
* leaflet: A JavaScript library for creating interactive maps
* plotly.js: A JavaScript library for creating interactive plots

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the application by opening the index.html file in a web browser.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the application works:

1. The user enters a location in the search bar.
2. The application fetches air quality data for the given location from the OpenAQ API.
3. The application creates a map of the world and adds layers for air quality data and AQI stations.
4. The application creates a plot of air quality data for the given location.
5. The application displays the weather data for the given location on the screen.

2 APIs were used to complete this project. The Open Weather API was used to collect data on weather data. Open-Meteo API was used to collect data on Air quality and pollutants.

## Conclusion

In this project, we explored air quality data in the world, modeled air quality, and visualized the data to make it easier to understand. This project will help to raise awareness of air quality issues and promotes research into ways to improve air quality.
