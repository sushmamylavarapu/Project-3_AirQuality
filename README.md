# Project-3_AirQuality

This project is about exploring air quality data in the world. We will use the [Air Quality Index (AQI)] to measure air quality. The AQI is a measure of how polluted the air is, and it is based on several pollutants, including particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide.

## Data

The data for this project is from https://open-meteo.com/. The data includes the AQI and other pollutants, such as PM2.5, ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We will start by exploring the data to get a better understanding of air quality in the world. We will look at the distribution of the AQI, as well as the levels of different pollutants. We will also examine how air quality varies over time and location.

## Visualization

We will visualize the data to make it easier to understand. We will create maps of air quality in the world, and we will also create graphs of the AQI over time.

## Conclusion

In this project, we explored air quality data in the world. We modeled air quality and visualized the data to make it easier to understand. This project will help to raise awareness of air quality issues and promotes research into ways to improve air quality.
