# Project-3_AirQuality

This project is about exploring air quality data in the United States. We will use the [Air Quality Index (AQI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Quality_Index) to measure air quality. The AQI is a measure of how polluted the air is, and it is based on several pollutants, including particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide.

## Data

The data for this project is from the [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/airquality/air-data-maps). The EPA provides air quality data for over 6,000 locations in the United States. The data includes the AQI, as well as other pollutants, such as PM2.5, ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We will start by exploring the data to get a better understanding of air quality in the United States. We will look at the distribution of the AQI, as well as the levels of different pollutants. We will also look at how air quality varies over time and by location.

## Visualization

We will visualize the data to make it easier to understand. We will create maps of air quality in the world, and we will also create graphs of the AQI over time.

## Conclusion

In this project, we explored air quality data in the United States. We used machine learning to model air quality, and we visualized the data to make it easier to understand. We hope that this project will help to raise awareness of air quality issues and to promote research into ways to improve air quality.
